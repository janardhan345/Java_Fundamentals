# OOP in Java `Data Camp Course`

OOP is a paradigm program that considers turns real world objects into code using class, constructors and properties. 

- so we have a created an object called `Car` inside the main class
- then created a constructor `Car` constructors must have same name as class 
- inside constructors we add properties to distinguish each object.
- We create unique objects in terms of Java we instantiating the objects.
- to instantiate an object we have to use the keyword `new` and unique class or object such as Car can be used as parameters other than data types such as int, String, boolean etc.
- note : except class (object) all have parantheses. ex: constructor , method to pass in parameters.

# Methods 
- these are the functions of Java, here in OOP the method is an action performed by the object
  - Methods are classified into two types
    1. Void Method - doesn't return any data
    2. Non Void method - returns a data
